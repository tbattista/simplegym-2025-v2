```

### Migration Flow
```
1. Anonymous User Creates Data → localStorage
2. User Signs Up/In → Auth State Change
3. Migration Check → Eligibility Validation
4. Migration Prompt → User Consent
5. Data Preparation → Backup & Validation
6. Batch Migration → Firestore Upload
7. Verification → Data Integrity Check
8. Completion → Success Notification
```
