## Testing

```bash
# Install Playwright
npm install
npx playwright install

# Run all tests
npm test

# Specific test suites
npm run test:smoke       # Quick smoke tests
npm run test:api         # API health checks
npm run test:e2e         # Full workflow tests
npm run test:desktop     # Desktop browser tests
npm run test:mobile      # Mobile browser tests
```

## API

All endpoints are under `/api/v3/`. Firebase-specific endpoints use `/api/v3/firebase/`.

Authentication uses Bearer tokens (Firebase JWT). Anonymous users interact with localStorage on the client side — no API calls needed.

Full interactive docs available at `/docs` when running locally.

## Deployment

Deployed on [Railway](https://railway.app) using the NIXPACKS builder.

```bash
# Health check endpoint
GET /api/health
```
