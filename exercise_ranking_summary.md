# Exercise Ranking System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The exercise ranking system has been designed to improve search results by prioritizing exercises based on multiple factors:

1. **Tier Classification**
2. **User Favorites**
3. **Exercise Popularity**
4. **Search Relevance**

## Tier Classification System

Exercises are classified into three tiers:

| Tier | Name | Score Range | Description | Priority Boost |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | FOUNDATION | 90-100 | Essential movements every lifter should know | +30 points |
| 2 | STANDARD | 60-89 | Common variations and proven accessory exercises | +15 points |
| 3 | SPECIALIZED | 0-59 | Advanced skills, specialized equipment, niche movements | +0 points |

## Ranking Algorithm

The ranking formula is:

```
Rank Score = (Base Relevance Score) + 
             (Tier Boost) + 
             (Favorite Boost) + 
             (Popularity Boost)
```

Where:
- **Base Relevance Score**: How well the exercise matches the search query (0-100)
- **Tier Boost**: 
  - Tier 1: +30 points
  - Tier 2: +15 points
  - Tier 3: +0 points
- **Favorite Boost**: +25 points if the user has favorited the exercise
- **Popularity Boost**: (popularityScore / 4) points (0-25 range)

This gives a maximum score of 180 points.

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Added tier filter parameter to search API endpoint
   - Implemented ranking algorithm in exercise service
   - Integrated with favorites service for personalized results

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Updated search component to support tier filtering
   - Enhanced exercise display with tier badges
   - Implemented client-side ranking for cached results

## Benefits of the New Ranking System

1. **Improved User Experience**: Beginners will see foundational exercises first, helping them build proper exercise knowledge.

2. **Personalization**: Users will see their favorite exercises ranked higher, creating a more tailored experience.

3. **Community-Driven**: Popular exercises get a boost, leveraging collective wisdom.

4. **Specialized Discovery**: Advanced users can still find specialized exercises when needed through specific searches or filters.

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Usage Patterns**: Track how users interact with the new ranking system.

2. **Refine Weights**: Adjust the weighting factors based on user feedback and behavior.

3. **Add UI Controls**: Consider adding explicit UI controls to let users adjust ranking preferences.

4. **Expand Filters**: Add more filter options based on the rich exercise metadata available.
