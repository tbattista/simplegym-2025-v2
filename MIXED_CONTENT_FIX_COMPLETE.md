# Mixed Content Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
Your Railway app was served over HTTPS, but API calls were being made to HTTP URLs, causing browsers to block the requests with "Mixed Content" errors.

## Root Cause
In [`frontend/js/firebase/data-manager.js`](frontend/js/firebase/data-manager.js:10), the URL construction logic was:
1. Hardcoding `http://localhost:8000` for development (wrong port)
2. Force-setting protocol to `https:` instead of using `window.location.protocol`

## Solution Applied

### Fixed `getApiUrl()` function (Line 10-33)
**Before:**
```javascript
// In production, always use HTTPS
const protocol = 'https:';  // ❌ Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```javascript
// In production, use same protocol as page
const protocol = window.location.protocol;  // ✅ Dynamic (will be 'https:' on Railway)
```

### Fixed `getApiBaseUrl()` function (Line 53-95)
**Before:**
```javascript
// Development
return 'http://localhost:8000';  // ❌ Wrong port

// Production
let baseUrl = `https://${hostname}`;  // ❌ Hardcoded HTTPS
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Development
return 'http://localhost:8001';  // ✅ Correct port

// Production
const protocol = window.location.protocol;  // ✅ Dynamic
let baseUrl = `${protocol}//${hostname}`;
```

## How It Works Now

### Development (localhost)
- Page: `http://localhost:8001/`
- API calls: `http://localhost:8001/api/...`
- ✅ Same protocol, no Mixed Content errors

### Production (Railway)
- Page: `https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app/`
- API calls: `https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/...`
- ✅ Same protocol, no Mixed Content errors

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Mixed Content: The page at 'https://...' was loaded over HTTPS, 
   but requested an insecure resource 'http://...'. 
   This request has been blocked.
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ All API calls use HTTPS
✅ No Mixed Content errors
✅ Data loads successfully
```

## Files Modified
- [`frontend/js/firebase/data-manager.js`](frontend/js/firebase/data-manager.js:10) - Fixed URL construction logic

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes all API calls in production
- ✅ Maintains localhost development workflow
- ✅ No configuration changes needed
- ✅ Works automatically on Railway
