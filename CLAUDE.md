# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Task Completion Summary

After completing any action or task, provide a brief 2-3 sentence summary that includes:
1. What the user asked for
2. What was done to fulfill the request

Example: "You asked me to add a logout button to the navbar. I added a logout button in `navbar.html` that calls `authService.logout()` and redirects to the login page."

## Git Commit Message

After completing any task that modifies code, always provide a ready-to-use git commit command that the user can copy and paste. Use conventional commit format:

```bash
git commit -m "type: brief description of changes"
```

**Commit types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring without changing behavior
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies, config
- `style:` - Formatting, whitespace (no code change)
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests

---

## Build & Run Commands

```bash
# Start development server (runs on port 8001)
python run.py

# API documentation available at http://localhost:8001/docs

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Architecture Overview

Fitness Field Notes is a workout log generator with:
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) serving REST API and static files
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap 5 (Sneat template)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (cloud) with localStorage fallback
- **PDF Generation**: Gotenberg microservice (Docker-based)
- **Deployment**: Railway with NIXPACKS builder

│   │   └── components/  # Reusable UI (modals, offcanvas, cards)
│   └── css/             # Component-scoped styles
```

### Key Data Flow
1. **Authentication**: Firebase Auth → JWT token in Bearer header
2. **Storage**: Authenticated users → Firestore, Anonymous → localStorage
3. **Workout Mode**: WorkoutModeController → SessionService → DataManager → API

### Frontend Patterns
- Services registered on `window` object (window.authService, window.dataManager)
- Event-driven communication (authStateChanged, themeChanged events)
- Controllers compose multiple services (lifecycle, timer, weight managers)
- Modal/Offcanvas managers handle Bootstrap component lifecycle

### API Patterns
- All endpoints under `/api/v3/` prefix
- Firebase-specific endpoints under `/api/v3/firebase/`
- Dual-mode: Firebase for authenticated, local storage for anonymous
- FastAPI Depends() for service injection and auth

## Data Validation Rules
- Workout names: 1-50 characters
- Exercise names: 1-100 characters
- Sets/Reps: Flexible format - supports numbers, ranges, or plain text (e.g., "3", "8-12", "AMRAP")
- Rest format: number + unit (e.g., "60s", "2min")

## Key Files for Common Tasks

**Adding API endpoints**: `backend/api/` - create new router, register in main.py
**Workout session logic**: `frontend/assets/js/services/workout-session-service.js`
**Exercise card rendering**: `frontend/assets/js/components/exercise-card-renderer.js`
**Auth flow**: `frontend/assets/js/services/auth-service.js`
**Firebase config**: `frontend/assets/js/app-config.js`

## Environment Variables
Required in `.env`:
- FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY, FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
- RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN (for share URLs in production)
- GOTENBERG_URL (PDF service, optional)
- PORT (defaults to 8001)

## Workflow Modes (Cline-Style)

Use these modes to control Claude's behavior. Say the mode name or use the trigger phrase to activate.

### 🏗️ Architect Mode
**Trigger:** "architect mode", "plan mode", "design mode"

**Role Definition:**
You are an experienced technical leader and software architect. Your job is to analyze requirements, explore the codebase, design systems, and create detailed implementation plans. You focus on high-level design, architecture decisions, and strategic planning.

**Allowed Tools:**
| Tool | Allowed | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Read | ✅ | Read any file |
| Glob | ✅ | Find files by pattern |
| Grep | ✅ | Search file contents |
| Task (Explore) | ✅ | Explore codebase |
| WebSearch | ✅ | Research solutions |
| WebFetch | ✅ | Fetch documentation |
| AskUserQuestion | ✅ | Clarify requirements |
| TodoWrite | ✅ | Plan tasks |
| Write | ⚠️ | **ONLY** to `/plans/*.md` files |
| Edit | ❌ | No code editing |
| Bash | ⚠️ | Read-only commands only (git status, ls, cat) |

**Behavior:**
- DO NOT edit, write, or modify any code files
- DO NOT run commands that make changes (only read-only commands)
- DO explore the codebase thoroughly using Glob, Grep, Read tools
- DO ask clarifying questions about requirements
- DO create detailed implementation plans in markdown
- DO identify potential issues, edge cases, and trade-offs
- DO suggest file structure and architectural patterns
- DO write plans to `/plans/` folder as markdown files
- DO use TodoWrite to break down the implementation into clear steps

**Output Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis
[Understanding of the current state]

## Proposed Solution
[High-level approach]

## Implementation Plan
1. Step one...
2. Step two...

## Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.js` - Description of changes

## Risks & Considerations
- Risk 1...
```

---

### 🪃 Orchestrator Mode
**Trigger:** "orchestrator mode", "boomerang mode", "plan and implement"

**Role Definition:**
You are a strategic workflow coordinator. You break down complex tasks into phases: first architect/plan, then implement.

**Allowed Tools:** All tools, but used in phases:
- **Phase 1 (Planning):** Use Architect Mode tool restrictions
- **Phase 2 (Implementation):** Use Code Mode tool restrictions

**Behavior:**
1. Start in **Architect Mode** - analyze and create a plan
2. Present the plan and ask for approval
3. Switch to **Code Mode** - implement the approved plan
4. Verify the implementation works

---

## Mode Switching

You can switch modes at any time by saying:
- "Switch to architect mode" - Stop coding, focus on planning
- "Switch to code mode" - Start implementing
- "Switch to ask mode" - Just answer questions
- "Switch to debug mode" - Focus on troubleshooting

**Default behavior:** If no mode is specified, use your judgment:
- New features → Start with Architect Mode
- Bug fixes → Start with Debug Mode
- Questions → Use Ask Mode
- Simple changes → Go directly to Code Mode

## Plan File Convention

When creating plans, save them to:
```
/plans/{feature-name}-plan.md
```

Example: `/plans/user-authentication-plan.md`
