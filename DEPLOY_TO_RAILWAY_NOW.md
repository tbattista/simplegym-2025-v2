# üöÄ Railway Deployment - Mixed Content Fix

## ‚úÖ Code Changes Deployed

You've deployed the updated code to Railway. Now you need to ensure the browser loads the new files.

## üîÑ Clear Browser Cache

The Mixed Content errors are likely from cached JavaScript files. Try these steps:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh (Recommended)
1. Open your Railway app: https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app/
2. **Hard refresh** to bypass cache:
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. Check if Mixed Content errors are gone

### Option 2: Clear Cache in DevTools
1. Open DevTools (`F12`)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Check "**Disable cache**" checkbox
4. Refresh the page (`F5`)

### Option 3: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new **Incognito/Private** window
2. Navigate to: https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app/
3. This ensures no cached files are used

## üß™ Verify the Fix

After clearing cache, check the browser console:

### ‚úÖ Expected (Good):
```
üîó API Base URL: https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app
üîç DEBUG: API Base URL construction: {
  protocol: 'https:',
  hostname: 'simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app',
  constructed: 'https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app'
}
```

### ‚ùå Old (Bad - if you still see this):
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://...' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://...'.
```

## üîç Debug: Check Actual URLs Being Called

In the browser console, run this to see what URLs are being constructed:

```javascript
// Test the getApiUrl function
console.log('Test URLs:');
console.log('Programs:', window.getApiUrl('/api/v3/firebase/programs'));
console.log('Workouts:', window.getApiUrl('/api/v3/firebase/workouts'));
console.log('API Base:', window.dataManager.apiBase);
```

**Expected output:**
```
Test URLs:
Programs: https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/v3/firebase/programs
Workouts: https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app/api/v3/firebase/workouts
API Base: https://simplegym-v2-production.up.railway.app
```

## üö® If Still Seeing HTTP URLs

If you're still seeing `http://` in the URLs after hard refresh, there might be another file constructing URLs. Check:

1. **Verify deployment succeeded**:
   - Check Railway dashboard for successful deployment
   - Look for build logs showing "Deployment successful"

2. **Check file timestamps**:
   - In DevTools Network tab, check if `data-manager.js` has recent timestamp
   - If it's old, the deployment might not have updated the file

3. **Force Railway rebuild**:
   ```bash
   # Make a small change to trigger rebuild
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Railway rebuild"
   git push
   ```

## üìã Next Steps After Cache Clear

Once Mixed Content errors are gone:

1. **Test menu navigation**:
   - Click "Dashboard" - should show all panels
   - Click "My Programs" - should focus on programs
   - Click "Workout Library" - should focus on workouts
   - Click "Exercise Database" - should show full-width view

2. **Test data loading**:
   - Sign in with your account
   - Create a test program
   - Create a test workout
   - Verify they appear in the lists

3. **Delete old frontend directories** (if not done yet):
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force frontend-v1
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force frontend-v2
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force frontend-v0.4.1
   ```

## üéØ Summary

**What you need to do:**
1. ‚úÖ Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl + Shift + R`)
2. ‚úÖ Verify no Mixed Content errors
3. ‚úÖ Test menu navigation works
4. ‚úÖ Delete old frontend directories locally

**Files that were updated:**
- [`frontend/js/firebase/data-manager.js`](frontend/js/firebase/data-manager.js:10) - Fixed HTTPS protocol
- [`frontend/dashboard.html`](frontend/dashboard.html:127) - Fixed menu links
- [`frontend/js/menu-navigation.js`](frontend/js/menu-navigation.js:1) - New navigation system
- [`backend/main.py`](backend/main.py:60) - Removed old routes
