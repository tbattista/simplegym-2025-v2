## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Consistency with Exercise Database
- Same layout structure (3-column sidebar + 9-column main)
- Same filter sidebar design
- Same table styling
- Same pagination controls
- Same loading/empty states

### Key Differences
- Workout-specific filters (exercise count instead of muscle group)
- Different table columns (groups, exercises, tags, modified date)
- Workout detail modal instead of exercise detail modal
- Three action buttons instead of favorite + actions

---

## 🔌 API Integration

### Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v3/firebase/workouts/` - Load all user workouts
- `GET /api/v3/firebase/workouts/{id}` - Get specific workout (for modal)

### Authentication
- Uses `window.dataManager.getAuthToken()` for Firebase authentication
- Falls back gracefully for anonymous users

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface WorkoutTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  exercise_groups: ExerciseGroup[];
  bonus_exercises: BonusExercise[];
  tags: string[];
  created_date: string;
  modified_date: string;
}
```

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Desktop (> 992px)
- Full 3-column sidebar + 9-column main layout
- All table columns visible
- Horizontal action buttons

### Tablet (768px - 991px)
- Stacked layout (filters above table)
- Hide tags column
- Smaller fonts and padding

### Mobile (< 768px)
- Single column layout
- Hide groups, exercises, and modified date columns
- Show only name and actions
- Vertical action buttons
- Collapsible filters
